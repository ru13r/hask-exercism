Just like we have hGetContents that works like getContents but for a specific file, there's also hGetLine, hPutStr, hPutStrLn, hGetChar, etc. They work just like their counterparts without the h, only they take a handle as a parameter and operate on that specific file instead of operating on standard input or standard output. Example: putStrLn is a function that takes a string and returns an I/O action that will print out that string to the terminal and a newline after it. hPutStrLn takes a handle and a string and returns an IO action that will write that string to the file associated with the handle and then put a newline after it. In the same vein, hGetLine takes a handle and returns an I/O action that reads a line from its file.
